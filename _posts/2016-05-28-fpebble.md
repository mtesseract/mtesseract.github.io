I hacked together a very rudimentary PureScript binding for the [PebbleJS](https://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/) API, which allows for the writing of Pebble applications using Javascript.

The project is named FPebble and its repository can be found on [Github](https://github.com/mtesseract/FPebble)..

To get an impression of how a simple Pebble application can look like using PureScript, have a look at the [demo application](https://github.com/mtesseract/FPebble/blob/master/src/PureScript/src/Main.purs).
