My name is Moritz Clasmeier. I studied mathematics and philosophy at the [Ruhr Universit√§t Bochum](https://www.rub.de), where I have received a diploma and a doctorate in mathematics.

Currently I am working as a software engineer. Among the technologies that are particularly interesting to me are [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org), [Nix](https://nixos.org) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
