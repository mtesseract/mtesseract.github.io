  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So, I am one of those tech-affine parents, who wanted to build some kind of Jukebox device for
their child. In this post I provide an overview of my specific jukebox implementation.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://tonies.de/">commercial products</a> and existing <a href="http://phoniebox.de/index-en.html">hobbyist
projects</a>, but for several reasons I decided
to work on my own project. It is called <em>Rustberry Jukebox</em> and the core
software is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>. Even though the name
might suggest otherwise, please note that this is not related to an existing
Rust <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustberry">crate</a> with a similar name.</p>

<p>The feature set I had in mind for the jukebox device:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rustic/old aesthetics (as opposed to the polished modern interface of commercial products)</li>
  <li>Stream music from Spotify via WLAN</li>
  <li>Playback controllable via RFID tags</li>
  <li>Hardware button for switching the jukebox on and off</li>
  <li>Status LEDs (jukebox running and jukebox playing)</li>
  <li>The code should be conveniently cross-compilable for a Raspberry Pi.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the resulting jukebox:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/jukebox-open.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/jukebox-open.jpg" alt="Jukebox Open" style="width:30%;" /></a>
<a href="/assets/images/jukebox-open-2.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/jukebox-open-2.jpg" alt="Jukebox Open" style="width:40%;" /></a></p>

<p>Let us now have a closer look.</p>

<h2 id="components">Components</h2>

<h3 id="the-case">The Case</h3>

<p>I am pretty unexperienced when it
comes to physical manufacturing. Fortunately I found a potential enclosing, which seemed
promising: an old looking <a href="https://www.amazon.de/BRYNNBERG-Schatztruhe-Marco-38x27x14cm-Aufbewahrungsbox/dp/B07CMPTSD9/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=2X2CTDPJTEGAA&amp;keywords=holzkiste+verschlie%C3%9Fbar&amp;qid=1570263909&amp;s=kitchen&amp;sprefix=holzkiste+vers%2Ckitchen%2C165&amp;sr=1-3">suitcase / treasure
chest</a>.
I thought it might be feasible to build a double bottom into this suitcase,
having enough hidden space for all the tech stuff inside (Raspberry Pi,
speakers, power, circuits, cables / adapters) and providing enough space above
the double bottom for user controls and RFID-equipped <em>records</em>.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/jukebox-suitcase.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/jukebox-suitcase.jpg" alt="Jukebox Suitcase" style="width:40%;" /></a></p>

<h3 id="the-records">The Records</h3>

<p>What should the RFID tags be attached to, if one does not want to use plain RFID
cards or transponders? Again, I was lucky to find a product, which
matches the intended rustic aesthetics and allows for cheap extensibility:
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B078HB4ZD7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;language=en_GB&amp;psc=1">wooden
discs</a>.
The idea is to stick the RFID tag to the bottom side of a disk and use the top
side for artwork.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/jukebox-records.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/jukebox-records.jpg" alt="Jukebox Records" style="width:40%;" /></a></p>

<h3 id="the-tech">The Tech</h3>

<p>I had an old Raspberry Pi 2 laying around, which I intended to use as a
technological foundation for the jukebox. The playback should be controllable
via RFID tags – a technology, which I am not familiar with at all. After some
research I had identified the <a href="http://wiki.sunfounder.cc/index.php?title=Mifare_RC522_Module_RFID_Reader">MIFARE
RC522</a>
as a common and well-supported RFID reader/writerfor suitable for <a href="https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-rfid-rc522/">use with a
Raspberry Pi</a>. This device is
compatible with RFID tags such as <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B01HEU96C6">MIFARE Classic 1K Chip,
13.56mhz</a>.</p>

<p>For enabling audio output, I went with the <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00JRW0M32">Trust Leto 2.0 USB
Speakers</a>. I was somewhat worried
about the energy consumption (6W) of these speakers, since I prefer to not use
additional power sources besides the Raspberry Pi’s own USB connectors for
compactness reasons. But they seem to work fine at medium volume. The USB speakers connect to
the computer via a standard stereo jack, but as is well-known the stereo jack
output of the Raspberry Pi offers poor quality. Therefore I have decided to
extract the audio signal from the Raspberry HDMI output using a simple
<a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00ZMV7RL2">HDMI-to-VGA adapter</a> capable of
extracting the HDMI audio signal.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/jukebox-inner.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/jukebox-inner.jpg" alt="Jukebox Inner" style="width:40%;" /></a></p>

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>As mentioned above there are already software solutions for an
RFID-controllable jukebox. But after a quick look at the <a href="https://www.phoniebox.de">Phoniebox</a> software <a href="https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID">RPi-Jukebox-RFID</a> I decided to build my
<a href="https://github.com/mtesseract/rustberry">own project</a>. The primary motives for this decision include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>RPi-Jukebox-RFID seems like a rather huge Python project and I am neither particularly familiar
with Python tooling, nor with the Python ecosystem. Also, I have not had the best experiences with Python
codebases in the past, though I cannot judge about the quality of this
particular project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently I am primarily interested in one particular
use-case: Spotify integration – which is labelled as “experimental” for
RPi-Jukebox-RFID. I wanted something more compact and simple.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From the introductory video of the Phoniebox it seems that the RFID-control
logic is such that an RFID tag is used only for <em>triggering</em> playback. What I
would prefer is that an RFID tag is used for controlling the playback, which
means <em>starting</em> and <em>stopping</em> it, similar to the commercial Toniebox:
Playback is active as long as the RFID tag is in range of the RFID reader.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After evaluation of a few options I decided to build the software with Rust,
since I learned to like that language, it performs well, has a great package
ecosystem, can be used for lower-level hardware access, comes with a low memory
footprint and it has a pretty good cross-compilation story. Besides, I have
never worked on a similar project and it seemed like an interesting learning opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="spotify-playback">Spotify Playback</h3>

<p>Regarding Spotify Playback, my initial plan was to run Firefox on the Raspberry
Pi and use the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/">Spotify Web
SDK</a> for
providing the Spotify streaming capabilities. This worked pretty well on my
development machine. But once I tried it out on the Raspberry I had learn the
hard way that the Spotify Web SDK requires Widevine DRM Support, which the
non-official Firefox builds do not contain (and for ARM there are no official
Firefox builds). So this was my daily lesson in the category “Integrate early”.
So, how do I stream from Spotify? Well,
<a href="https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot">Librespot</a> comes to the rescue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>librespot is an open source client library for Spotify. It enables
applications to use Spotify’s service, without using the official but
closed-source libspotify. Additionally, it will provide extra features which
are not available in the official library.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Librespot is used and packaged by the
<a href="https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify">Raspotify</a> project. They provide easy to
install Debian packages for ARM Raspbian. With Raspotify installed and
configured to use a specific Spotify Premium account, the Raspberry is ready to
be used as Spotify client through the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify Web
API</a>.</p>

<h3 id="os">OS</h3>

<p>Actually I would have preferred being able to use <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> on the Raspberry Pi, but
unfortunately the ARM port of NixOS was way to rough around the edges for my use-case. The issues I
have had with NixOS even on my Raspberry Pi 3, which comes with an AARCH64 CPU
somewhat supported by upstream NixOS, included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing and/or incomplete documentation, in particular when it comes to
configuring the Raspberry Pi firmware and the boot process (after having
written a first <code class="highlighter-rouge">configuration.nix</code> according to the documentation, the
Raspberry Pi was unable to boot).</li>
  <li>The boot process is slower than Raspbian’s.</li>
  <li>After about 2h work I was still not able to get audio working – something
that just works on Raspbian.</li>
</ul>

<p>With NixOS I like being able to declaratively configure the complete operating
system with all required services and deploy a system configuration to a remote
NixOS with complete rollback functionality built-in.  Maybe somewhen in the
future I can write the NixOS derivations for my Jukebox Software and deploy it
to a Raspberry Pi running NixOS. But this is not today.</p>

<p>Given this unsatisfying situation I have decided to build on <strong>Raspbian</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="rfid-io">RFID IO</h3>

<p>A quick search on <a href="">crates.io</a> revealed the following list of potentially useful crates:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rfid-rs">rfid-rs</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/mfrc522">mfrc522</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that <em>mfrc522</em> is currently very limited in functionality (see
https://docs.rs/mfrc522/0.2.0/mfrc522/struct.Mfrc522.html) and does not yet
support reading and writing the data blocks on an RFID tag. <em>rfid-rs</em> on the
other side does
support reading from and writing to the RFID tag’s data blocks, but the <a href="https://gitlab.com/jspngh/rfid-rs">upstream code
base</a> had some issues, which is why I have
created my <a href="https://gitlab.com/mclasmeier/rfid-rs">personal fork</a> for the
purpose of this project. I will see if my changes can be integrated into the
upstream version of the crate.</p>

<h3 id="gpio">GPIO</h3>

<p>For GPIO access there are multiple crates available, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/gpio-cdev">gpio-cdev</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/gpio">gpio</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/sysfs_gpio">sysfs_gpio</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I have decided to go with <em>gpio-cdev</em>, since – according to my understanding – using the character device API for GPIO is
recommended for new applications. I have been missing some built-in functionality for
listening for events on mutliple GPIO lines at the same time, but that was easy
to implement using threads and channels.</p>

<p>At some point I had confused the different GPIO line labeling systems. For debugging GPIO, the following command turned out to be very helpful:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>watch -d -n 0.5 gpio -g readall
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gpio</code> program comes from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">wiringpi</code> package)</p>

<h2 id="circuits">Circuits</h2>

<p>For the first vesion of the Jukebox the following hardware related functionality should be be supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single physical button for switching the box on and shutting it down.</li>
  <li>Stable RFID tag reading via the RC522 reader.</li>
  <li>A status LED indicating that the box is running.</li>
  <li>A status LED for indicating that it is in playback mode (i.e. an RFID tag is
near the RFID reader).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="power-switch">Power Switch</h3>

<p>I found <a href="https://howchoo.com/g/mwnlytk3zmm/how-to-add-a-power-button-to-your-raspberry-pi">an article</a>, which describes
the wake-up functionality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simply put, shorting pins 5 and 6 (GPIO3 and GND) together will wake the Pi up from a halt state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As indicated above, there should be a single physical button for switching the
device on and shutting it down. Therefore, it is already clear that the power
button needs to be connected to GPIO3, which needs to be configured as an input
line. Since pressing the button is required to connect GPIO3 with GND, the
GPIO3 line needs to be set to high when the button is <em>not</em> pressed. In other
words, we need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor">Pull-up
resistor</a> connecting GPIO3
through a resistor with a voltage source when the button is not pressed. When
the button is pressed GPIO3 will be connected with GND.</p>

<h3 id="power-status-led">Power Status LED</h3>

<p>There is a nice hack for building a status LED: Connect a LED to the Raspberry
Pi’s serial console as described in the article <a href="https://howchoo.com/g/ytzjyzy4m2e/build-a-simple-raspberry-pi-led-power-status-indicator">Build a Simple Raspberry Pi LED
Power/Status
Indicator</a>.</p>

<h3 id="playback-status-led">Playback Status LED</h3>

<p>This is nothing fancy, just another LED conneted to a regular GPIO input line,
which is configured as output and controlled in software.</p>

<h2 id="cross-compilation">Cross Compilation</h2>

<p>I am currently developing on Darwin/x86_64, but the Raspberry Pi runs
Linux/ARMv7. I have created a <a href="https://github.com/mtesseract/rustberry/blob/master/builder/Dockerfile">Docker image
description</a>,
for a build container. The container contains the cross-compilation toolchain
and is reachable via SSH.
A <a href="https://github.com/mtesseract/rustberry/blob/master/builder/build.sh">build
script</a> is
used for producing binaries of the Rustberry Jukebox software for the Raspberry
Pi.</p>
